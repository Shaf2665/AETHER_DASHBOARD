## 📚 Linux Basics - Don't Worry, It's Easy!

**Never used Linux before?** Don't worry! Here's what you need to know:

### What is a VPS?
A **VPS (Virtual Private Server)** is like having your own computer in the cloud. You control it remotely.

### What is SSH?
**SSH (Secure Shell)** is how you connect to your VPS from your computer. It's like remote desktop, but for Linux.

### What is a Terminal?
A **terminal** (also called "command line" or "console") is a text-based way to control your computer. Instead of clicking buttons, you type commands.

### How to Use This Guide
- **Commands to type** are shown in gray boxes like this:
  ```bash
  type this command here
  ```
- **Replace text** in `brackets` with your actual information
- **Press Enter** after typing each command
- **Don't type the `$` or `#`** - those are just prompts showing you're in the terminal

### Common Terms You'll See
- **`sudo`** = "super user do" - gives you permission to do admin tasks (you'll type your password)
- **`cd`** = "change directory" - moves you to a different folder
- **`nano`** = a simple text editor (like Notepad, but in terminal)
- **`pm2`** = a tool that keeps your dashboard running

**Don't worry if this seems confusing!** Just follow the steps one by one, and you'll be fine! 🚀

## 📋 What You Need Before Starting

Before installing, make sure you have:

1. **A Linux VPS** (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, or RHEL)
   - Most hosting providers use Linux
   - If you're not sure what you have, it's probably Ubuntu (most common)
   
2. **SSH access to your VPS**
   - Your VPS provider should give you:
     - An IP address (like `123.45.67.89`)
     - A username (usually `root` or `ubuntu`)
     - A password (or SSH key)
   
3. **A domain name** (optional but recommended)
   - You can start with just an IP address
   - Domain makes it look more professional (like `dashboard.yoursite.com`)

4. **Node.js** - We'll install this together (don't worry about it now!)

**Don't have a VPS yet?** Popular options:
- **DigitalOcean** - Very beginner-friendly, $5/month
- **Vultr** - Good performance, $2.50/month
- **Linode** - Reliable, $5/month
- **Hetzner** - Great value, €4/month
- **Contabo** - Budget-friendly

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Installation Guide

**Follow these steps in order. Don't skip any steps!**

### Step 1: Connect to Your VPS (SSH)

**What you're doing:** Connecting your computer to your VPS so you can control it.

#### On Windows:

1. **Download PuTTY** (free SSH client):
   - Go to: https://www.putty.org/
   - Download and install PuTTY
   - Or use Windows Terminal (Windows 10/11) or PowerShell

2. **Open PuTTY** (or Windows Terminal/PowerShell)

3. **Type this command:**
   ```bash
   ssh username@your-vps-ip
   ```
   
   **Replace:**
   - `username` with your VPS username (usually `root` or `ubuntu`)
   - `your-vps-ip` with your VPS IP address
   
   **Example:**
   ```bash
   ssh root@123.45.67.89
   ```

4. **Press Enter**

5. **If it asks "Are you sure you want to continue?"** - Type `yes` and press Enter

6. **Enter your password** when prompted (you won't see the password as you type - that's normal!)

7. **You're connected!** You should see something like:
   ```
   root@your-server:~#
   ```

#### On Mac/Linux:

1. **Open Terminal** (search for "Terminal" in Applications)

2. **Type the same command:**
   ```bash
   ssh username@your-vps-ip
   ```

3. **Follow the same steps as Windows**

**💡 Tip:** If you can't connect, check:
- Is your VPS running?
- Is the IP address correct?
- Did you enter the password correctly?
- Check your VPS provider's documentation for SSH setup

---

### Step 2: Update Your System

**What you're doing:** Making sure your VPS has the latest software updates.

**First, check what Linux you're using:**
```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

**Look for "NAME="** - it will say Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, or something similar.

#### If you have Ubuntu or Debian:

Type this command:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

**What this does:**
- `sudo` = gives you admin permission (you'll type your password)
- `apt update` = checks for updates
- `apt upgrade -y` = installs updates (the `-y` means "yes to everything")

**What you'll see:**
- It will ask for your password (type it and press Enter)
- Lots of text scrolling (this is normal!)
- It may take 1-5 minutes

#### If you have CentOS or RHEL:

Type this command:
```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

**Same thing, different command!**

**✅ When it's done:** You'll see your prompt again (like `root@server:~#`)

---

### Step 3: Install Node.js

**What you're doing:** Installing Node.js, which is needed to run the dashboard.

#### For Ubuntu/Debian:

**Step 3.1: Install curl (a tool we need)**
```bash
sudo apt install curl -y
```

**Step 3.2: Add Node.js repository**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
```

**What this does:** Downloads and sets up the Node.js installation files

**What you'll see:** Lots of text scrolling - this is normal! Wait for it to finish.

**Step 3.3: Install Node.js**
```bash
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

**What you'll see:** More text scrolling. Wait for it to finish.

**Step 3.4: Check if it worked**
```bash
node --version
```

**What you should see:** Something like `v20.11.0` or similar (a version number)

**Also check npm:**
```bash
npm --version
```

**What you should see:** Something like `10.2.4` or similar

**✅ If you see version numbers:** Node.js is installed correctly! 🎉

**❌ If you see "command not found":** Something went wrong. Try the steps again or check the troubleshooting section.

#### For CentOS/RHEL:

**Step 3.1: Install curl**
```bash
sudo yum install curl -y
```

**Step 3.2: Add Node.js repository**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo bash -
```

**Step 3.3: Install Node.js**
```bash
sudo yum install -y nodejs
```

**Step 3.4: Check if it worked**
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

**Same as above - you should see version numbers!**

---

### Step 4: Get the Dashboard Code on Your VPS

**What you're doing:** Getting the dashboard files onto your VPS.

**Choose one method:**

#### Option A: Upload Files via SFTP (Easiest for Beginners)

**This is like copying files to your VPS using a program like FileZilla.**

1. **Download FileZilla** (free):
   - Go to: https://filezilla-project.org/
   - Download FileZilla Client
   - Install it

2. **Open FileZilla**

3. **Connect to your VPS:**
   - **Host:** `sftp://your-vps-ip` (replace with your IP)
   - **Username:** Your VPS username
   - **Password:** Your VPS password
   - **Port:** `22`
   - Click **"Quickconnect"**

4. **Upload the dashboard folder:**
   - On the left: Find your dashboard folder on your computer
   - On the right: Navigate to `/root` or `/home/username`
   - Drag the dashboard folder from left to right
   - Wait for upload to finish

5. **In your SSH terminal, navigate to the folder:**
   ```bash
   cd AETHER_PANEL
   ```
   
   (Replace `AETHER_PANEL` with whatever you named the folder)

#### Option B: Clone from GitHub (If You Have GitHub)

**Only use this if you have the code on GitHub!**

**Step 4.1: Install git**
```bash
sudo apt install git -y  # Ubuntu/Debian
# OR
sudo yum install git -y  # CentOS/RHEL
```

**Step 4.2: Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AETHER_PANEL.git
```

**Replace `your-username/AETHER_PANEL` with your actual GitHub repository**

**Step 4.3: Go into the folder**
```bash
cd AETHER_PANEL
```

**✅ You should now be in the dashboard folder!**

**How to check:** Type `pwd` and press Enter. It should show the folder path.

---

### Step 5: Install Dependencies

**What you're doing:** Downloading all the code libraries the dashboard needs to run.

**Make sure you're in the dashboard folder first!** (You should be from Step 4)

Type this command:
```bash
npm install
```

**What this does:** Downloads and installs all required software packages

**What you'll see:**
- Lots of text scrolling (this is normal!)
- It may take 1-3 minutes
- You'll see lines like "added 245 packages"

**✅ When it's done:** You'll see your prompt again. No errors = success!

**❌ If you see errors:** Check the troubleshooting section.

---

### Step 6: Create Configuration File

**What you're doing:** Creating a settings file that tells the dashboard how to run.

**Step 6.1: Create the file**
```bash
nano .env
```

**What this does:** Opens a text editor called "nano" to create/edit the `.env` file

**What you'll see:** A blank screen (or some text if the file exists)

**Step 6.2: Copy and paste this content:**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Right-click in the terminal to paste (or `Shift + Insert`)

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=change-this-to-a-very-long-random-text-at-least-32-characters-abc123xyz789

# HTTPS Configuration (set to 'true' if using HTTPS/SSL)
USE_HTTPS=true

# Discord OAuth (optional - leave empty if not using)
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=
DISCORD_CALLBACK_URL=https://yourdomain.com/auth/discord/callback

# Pterodactyl Panel (optional - configure via Admin Panel after installation)
PTERODACTYL_URL=
PTERODACTYL_API_KEY=
```

**Step 6.3: Make these changes:**

1. **Change `SESSION_SECRET`:** 
   - Replace the long text with any random text (at least 32 characters)
   - Example: `my-super-secret-key-abc123xyz789-very-secure-2024`
   - You can use letters, numbers, and dashes

2. **If you have a domain:** Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain

3. **If using HTTP (not HTTPS):** Change `USE_HTTPS=true` to `USE_HTTPS=false`

**Step 6.4: Save the file:**

1. **Press `Ctrl + X`** (to exit)
2. **Press `Y`** (to confirm you want to save)
3. **Press `Enter`** (to confirm the filename)

**✅ You're back at the terminal!** The file is saved.

**💡 Tip:** If you make a mistake, just type `nano .env` again to edit it!

---

### Step 7: Start the Dashboard with PM2

**What you're doing:** Starting the dashboard and making sure it keeps running.

**PM2** is a tool that:
- Keeps your dashboard running even if it crashes
- Automatically restarts it if something goes wrong
- Keeps it running even if you close your SSH connection

**Step 7.1: Install PM2**
```bash
sudo npm install -g pm2
```

**What this does:** Installs PM2 globally so you can use it anywhere

**What you'll see:** Text scrolling, then your prompt returns

**Step 7.2: Start the dashboard**
```bash
pm2 start server.js --name aether-dashboard
```

**What this does:** Starts your dashboard with the name "aether-dashboard"

**What you should see:**
```
[PM2] Starting in fork_mode
[PM2] Successfully started
┌─────┬──────────────────┬─────────┬─────────┬──────────┐
│ id  │ name             │ status  │ restart │ uptime   │
├─────┼──────────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼──────────┤
│ 0   │ aether-dashboard │ online  │ 0       │ 0s       │
└─────┴──────────────────┴─────────┴─────────┴──────────┘
```

**✅ If you see this:** Your dashboard is running! 🎉

**Step 7.3: Save PM2 configuration**
```bash
pm2 save
```

**What this does:** Saves the current setup so PM2 remembers it

**Step 7.4: Set up auto-start on reboot**
```bash
pm2 startup
```

**What this does:** Makes the dashboard start automatically when your VPS reboots

**What you'll see:** It will give you a command to run. It will look like:
```
sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin pm2 startup systemd -u your-username --hp /home/your-username
```

**Copy that entire command** (the one starting with `sudo`) and paste it, then press Enter.

**✅ Done!** Your dashboard will now start automatically on reboot!

**Useful PM2 Commands (for later):**
```bash
pm2 list                    # See all running apps
pm2 logs aether-dashboard   # See what's happening (logs)
pm2 restart aether-dashboard  # Restart the dashboard
pm2 stop aether-dashboard     # Stop the dashboard
```

---

### Step 8: Configure Firewall

**What you're doing:** Opening the necessary ports so people can access your dashboard.

**Think of a firewall like a security guard** - it blocks everything unless you tell it what to allow.

**First, check what firewall you have:**

**For Ubuntu/Debian (most common):**
```bash
sudo ufw status
```

**If it says "Status: active"** - you have UFW firewall

**If it says "Status: inactive"** - firewall is off (you can skip this step, but it's recommended to enable it)

**Enable and configure UFW:**
```bash
sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp    # Allows dashboard access
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp      # Allows HTTP (for websites)
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp     # Allows HTTPS (secure websites)
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp      # Allows SSH (so you can still connect!)
sudo ufw enable            # Turns on the firewall
```

**What each line does:**
- `allow 3000/tcp` = Allows access to port 3000 (your dashboard)
- `allow 80/tcp` = Allows HTTP traffic
- `allow 443/tcp` = Allows HTTPS traffic
- `allow 22/tcp` = Allows SSH (so you don't lock yourself out!)
- `enable` = Turns on the firewall

**For CentOS/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=3000/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=22/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** If you're using a cloud provider (DigitalOcean, AWS, GCP, etc.), you ALSO need to configure their firewall in their control panel:
- DigitalOcean: Networking → Firewalls
- AWS: Security Groups
- GCP: VPC Network → Firewall Rules
- Add rules to allow ports 3000, 80, 443, and 22

---

### Step 9: Access Your Dashboard!

**What you're doing:** Opening your dashboard in a web browser!

**Option 1: Using IP Address (Quick Test)**

1. **Open your web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

2. **Go to:** `http://your-vps-ip:3000`
   
   Replace `your-vps-ip` with your actual VPS IP address
   
   **Example:** `http://123.45.67.89:3000`

3. **You should see the login page!** 🎉

**Option 2: Using Domain Name (Recommended)**

If you have a domain, set up Nginx (see the "Production Setup" section below).

**Default Admin Login:**
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin123`

**⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT:** Change this password immediately after logging in!

**How to change password:**
1. Log in
2. Click on your profile/settings
3. Find "Change Password"
4. Enter new password
5. Save

**💡 Forgot your password?** See the "Troubleshooting" section below for instructions on how to reset it without losing data!

## 💰 Setting Up Revenue Generation (Linkvertise)

**This is how you earn money from your free hosting!**

### Step 1: Get Your Linkvertise Publisher Account

1. **Go to:** https://publisher.linkvertise.com/
2. **Create an account** (if you don't have one)
   - Click "Sign Up"
   - Fill in your details
   - Verify your email
3. **Get your Publisher Link:**
   - After logging in, you'll see your Publisher Link
   - It looks like: `https://publisher.linkvertise.com/ac/1450748`
   - Copy this link
4. **Note your Publisher ID:**
   - It's the number at the end of the link (like `1450748`)

### Step 2: Configure Linkvertise in Your Dashboard

1. **Log into your dashboard** as admin
   - Go to your dashboard URL
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123` (change this!)

2. **Go to Admin Panel:**
   - Look for the shield icon (🛡️) in the sidebar
   - Click it

3. **Click the "Linkvertise" tab**

4. **In "Linkvertise Configuration":**
   - **Publisher Link:** Paste your Publisher Link here
   - **Publisher ID:** Will be filled automatically
   - **Default Coins:** Set how many coins users get per link (e.g., `10`)
   - **Cooldown Timer:** Set time between completions in seconds (e.g., `30`)
   - Click **"Save Configuration"**

**✅ Configuration saved!**

### Step 3: Add Your First Monetized Link

1. **In your Linkvertise dashboard:**
   - Create a new monetized link

2. **Back in your Aether Dashboard:**
   - In the "Manage Links" section
   - Click **"Add New Link"**

3. **Fill in the form:**
   - **Link Title:** "Complete this link" (or any name)
   - **Linkvertise URL:** Paste the monetized link from Linkvertise
     - ⚠️ **NOT** your publisher link!
     - This is the actual link users will complete
   - **Coins Reward:** How many coins users earn (e.g., `15`)
   - **Active:** Check this box (makes it visible to users)

4. **Click "Save Link"**

**✅ Your first monetized link is ready!**

### How Revenue Works

1. **Users visit your dashboard**
2. **They complete Linkvertise links** you've configured
3. **You earn money** from Linkvertise for each completion
4. **Users earn coins** which they can spend on server resources
5. **You control pricing** - set how many coins each resource costs

**It's that simple!** 💰

## 🌐 Setting Up Domain & HTTPS (Optional but Recommended)

**This makes your dashboard look more professional and secure.**

### Why Use a Domain?

- Looks professional: `https://dashboard.yoursite.com` vs `http://123.45.67.89:3000`
- More secure with HTTPS (SSL certificate)
- Easier for users to remember

### Step 1: Point Your Domain to Your VPS

**In your domain registrar (where you bought the domain):**

1. **Go to DNS settings**
2. **Add an A record:**
   - **Type:** A
   - **Name:** `dashboard` (or `@` for root domain)
   - **Value:** Your VPS IP address
   - **TTL:** 3600 (or default)

3. **Wait 5-30 minutes** for DNS to propagate

**How to check if it's working:**
```bash
ping dashboard.yourdomain.com
```

If you see your VPS IP, it's working!

### Step 2: Install Nginx

**Nginx** is a web server that handles your domain and HTTPS.

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

**For CentOS/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo yum install nginx -y
```

**Check if it's running:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

**You should see "active (running)"**

### Step 3: Create Nginx Configuration

**Step 3.1: Create the config file**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/aether-dashboard
```

**Step 3.2: Paste this configuration:**

**⚠️ Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain!**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        
        # Essential headers for sessions and reverse proxy
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;
        
        # WebSocket support (if needed)
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        
        # Cookie and session support
        proxy_cookie_path / /;
        
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

**Step 3.3: Save the file:**
- Press `Ctrl + X`
- Press `Y`
- Press `Enter`

**Step 3.4: Enable the site:**
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/aether-dashboard /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

**Step 3.5: Test the configuration:**
```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

**You should see:** `syntax is ok` and `test is successful`

**Step 3.6: Reload Nginx:**
```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

**✅ Nginx is configured!**

### Step 4: Set Up HTTPS (Free SSL Certificate)

**We'll use Let's Encrypt** - it's free and automatic!

**Step 4.1: Install Certbot**
```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
```

**Step 4.2: Get SSL Certificate**
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
```

**Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain!**

**What happens:**
- It will ask for your email (for renewal notices)
- It will ask to agree to terms (type `A` and press Enter)
- It will ask about sharing email (type `Y` or `N` and press Enter)
- It will automatically configure HTTPS!

**✅ Your dashboard now has HTTPS!**

**Step 4.3: Update your `.env` file:**
```bash
nano .env
```

**Change this line:**
```env
USE_HTTPS=true
```

**Save:** `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`

**Step 4.4: Restart the dashboard:**
```bash
pm2 restart aether-dashboard
```

**✅ Your dashboard is now accessible at `https://yourdomain.com`!**

**💡 Tip:** Certbot automatically renews your certificate. You don't need to do anything!

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "node: command not found"

**Problem:** Node.js isn't installed correctly.

**Solution:**
1. Go back to Step 3 (Install Node.js)
2. Make sure you followed all the steps
3. Try running the installation commands again
4. After installing, close and reopen your SSH connection

### "Port 3000 is already in use"

**Problem:** Something else is using port 3000.

**Solution:**
1. **Option 1:** Change the port in `.env` file:
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```
   Change `PORT=3000` to `PORT=3001`
   Save and restart: `pm2 restart aether-dashboard`

2. **Option 2:** Find what's using port 3000:
   ```bash
   sudo lsof -i :3000
   ```
   Stop that process

### "Cannot access dashboard from browser"

**Check these things:**

1. **Is the dashboard running?**
   ```bash
   pm2 list
   ```
   You should see `aether-dashboard` with status `online`

2. **Check the logs:**
   ```bash
   pm2 logs aether-dashboard
   ```
   Look for errors (red text)

3. **Test from the VPS itself:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000
   ```
   If this works, the problem is with firewall or network

4. **Check firewall:**
   - Make sure you completed Step 8 (Configure Firewall)
   - Check cloud provider firewall (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)

5. **Check if port is open:**
   - Use an online tool: https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/
   - Enter your VPS IP and port 3000

### "Login redirects back to login page"

**This is usually a session/cookie issue:**

1. **Check your `.env` file:**
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```
   - If using HTTPS, make sure `USE_HTTPS=true`
   - If using HTTP, make sure `USE_HTTPS=false`
   - Save and restart: `pm2 restart aether-dashboard`

2. **If using Nginx, check the configuration:**
   - Make sure all the proxy headers are set (see Nginx setup above)
   - Test config: `sudo nginx -t`
   - Reload: `sudo systemctl reload nginx`

3. **Check server logs:**
   ```bash
   pm2 logs aether-dashboard
   ```
   Look for any errors

### "Linkvertise not giving coins"

**Checklist:**
- ✅ Linkvertise configuration is saved in Admin Panel
- ✅ Link is marked as "Active" in Admin Panel
- ✅ Cooldown timer has expired (if applicable)
- ✅ Check server logs: `pm2 logs aether-dashboard`

### "I forgot my admin password"

**Don't worry!** You can reset your admin password without losing any data.

**Easy Solution (Recommended):**

1. **Connect to your VPS via SSH** (same way you installed the dashboard)

2. **Go to your dashboard folder:**
   ```bash
   cd AETHER_PANEL
   ```

3. **Run the password reset script:**
   ```bash
   node reset-admin-password.js "your-new-password-here"
   ```
   
   **Replace `your-new-password-here` with your desired password**
   
   **Example:**
   ```bash
   node reset-admin-password.js "mypassword123"
   ```

4. **You'll see a success message:**
   ```
   ✅ Admin password reset successfully!
   
   📝 Login Details:
      Username: admin
      Password: mypassword123
   ```

5. **Restart the dashboard (if it's running):**
   ```bash
   pm2 restart aether-dashboard
   ```

6. **Log in with your new password:**
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: (the password you just set)

**✅ What this does:**
- Resets ONLY the admin password
- Keeps ALL your data (users, servers, settings, etc.)
- Safe and easy to use

**❌ What this does NOT do:**
- Does NOT delete any data
- Does NOT affect other users
- Does NOT change any settings

**⚠️ Important Notes:**
- Make sure to remember your new password!
- Save it in a safe place
- The password must be at least 6 characters long

**Alternative Method (Only if script doesn't work):**

If the script doesn't work for some reason, you can delete the database file (⚠️ **WARNING: This deletes ALL data!**):

1. **Delete the database file:**
   ```bash
   cd AETHER_PANEL
   rm database.db
   ```

2. **Restart the dashboard:**
   ```bash
   pm2 restart aether-dashboard
   ```

3. **This creates a new admin account:**
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`

4. **⚠️ You'll lose ALL your data** (users, servers, settings, etc.)

**We recommend using the password reset script instead!**
